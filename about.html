    <h2>From Developer to Coach to International Speaker</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1.125rem; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
      My journey in Agile started in 2012 when I realized that the best software comes not just from technical excellence, 
      but from how teams work together. Since then, I've dedicated my career to helping teams achieve predictable delivery 
      through evidence-based practices, coaching 50+ teams across multiple industries.

  <!-- My Story -->
  <section class="card fade-in">
    <h2>My Story</h2>
    <p>
      I began my career as a Software Development Manager at The Nerdery, where I first discovered the power of Agile methodologies. 
      What started as implementing Scrum and Kanban to improve team productivity quickly evolved into a passion for understanding 
      the deeper principles of evidence-based management and sustainable delivery practices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the years, I've had the privilege of working with diverse teams—from small startups to enterprise organizations—helping 
      them navigate the challenges of Agile adoption, scaling, and transformation. My approach centers on three core pillars: 
      <strong>people, product, and process</strong>, always grounded in data and real-world outcomes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, I'm a Senior Scrum Master at Ascensus, where I launched a Kanban Center of Excellence and continue to drive measurable 
      improvements in team effectiveness. I'm also privileged to share these learnings on international stages, having spoken at 
      40+ conferences across Europe, North America, and beyond.
